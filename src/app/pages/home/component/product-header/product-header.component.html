<!-- The mat-card element is used to create a Material Design card container.
Inside the card, there is a div element with a class of flex justify-between.
 This creates a flex container with two items 
that are spaced evenly on the horizontal axis.
The first item in the flex container contains
 a button with a matMenuTriggerFor attribute that is set to a reference
  to a Material Design menu component (mat-menu).
   The button also contains an icon and some text that displays the current sort order (Sort by {{ sort }}).
The second item in the flex container contains three buttons 
that each have an icon and a click event handler 
that calls a method in the component's TypeScript code. These buttons
 are used to toggle the number of columns displayed in the grid.
Inside the Material Design menu (mat-menu) referenced by the first button, 
there are two button elements with (click) event handlers that call methods in the component's TypeScript code.
 These buttons are used to toggle the sort order of the items being displayed.
Below the first button, there is another div element with a class of flex items-center. 
This creates another flex container that contains two items: a button and a mat-menu component.
The button in the second flex container is similar to the buttons in the first flex container,
 but it displays the number of items currently being displayed (Show {{ itemsShowCount }})
  instead of the sort order.
The mat-menu component in the second flex container is used to display a dropdown menu of options for the number of items to display. The mat-menu component is referenced by the matMenuTriggerFor attribute on the button.
Inside the mat-menu component, there are three button elements with (click) event handlers that call methods in the component's TypeScript code. These buttons are used to set the number of items to display to 12, 24, or 36. -->
